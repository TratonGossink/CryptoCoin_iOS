# CryptoCoin_iOS

Welcome to CryptoCoin! Are you curious to know what the current trade price of Bitcoin?  Then look no further! This app will fetch and display the current Bitcoin price in your currency preference.  

### About

This project was a derived concept from a bootcamp project. This app is designed to retrieve the current Bitcoin price rat per share. 
The current price is displayed in the selected currency from the scroll wheel selection. You can choose from 21 of the worlds most common currencies.
This app can keep you from wondering what the Bitcoin value is doing. 
Building this project from stratch helped to refine my auto layout skills. 
Skills that where learned and enhanced in this app development: The set up and use of REST API's, connection and use of the scroll wheel, set up and use of errors and error checking, fetching and retrieving data from web based data sources, further expansion of fundamental swift programming skills.
